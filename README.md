<h3>The Evolution</h3>
<p>The main evolution with respect to the previous version will be the implementation of more artificial intelligences, in all possible and feasible places, in order to improve the existing freatures

<h3>Quality Freatures</h3>
<p>there will be a commitment not to keep adding a lot of cheap functions with low quality, I plan to make sure that every function that is added on promet.eu has a lot of quality, in addition the code will be all written and documented in english including the comments , so that when the code is finalized it has great compatibility with the world
